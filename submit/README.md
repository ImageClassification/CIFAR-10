The folder code contains code that we wrote to improve our performance
on the CIFAR-10 Kaggle Dataset for 10-601 Spring 2014.
Some of the code calls external libraries, which have to be installed in order 
to run the code.

For more information, please refer to our report, as well as 
comments in our git-hub repository:
